***
This project is a math quiz application that takes in a csv 
file and parses the data to test the user in real-time with 
a 30 second timer and displays results when the program ends.
This program also tests the csv file to make sure no issues 
occur when running the program. It also validates user input
to ensure integers are only used to answer. Error checking is
also implemented to make sure any questions within the csv 
file is invalid or not.
